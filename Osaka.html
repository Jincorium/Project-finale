        <p>It‚Äôs an event several years in the making, and it‚Äôs almost here. At the time of writing we have just over one month until the Osaka Expo 2025 opens to the general public.

However, public awareness of this once in a generation event isn‚Äôt where it should be. So today, we at Osaka.com would like to fix that. Today, we will seek to answer the questions that you, the readers have sent us over the past few months. Here is your definitive guide to the Osaka World Expo 2025.</p>

        <h3>What is Osaka Expo 2025?</h3>
        <p>Osaka Expo 2025 is a collaborative event between Osaka‚Äôs local government, the Japanese national government, dozens of other nations and business from both the domestic and international private sector.</p>
        <p>The Expo has one unifying theme: <em>‚ÄúDesigning Future Society For Our Lives‚Äù</em>.</p>
        <h3>Who is Taking Part in Osaka Expo 2025?</h3>
        <p>Some readers have cited eerie coincidences between the story‚Äôs timeline and real-life seismic activity. The manga's portrayal of infrastructure collapse, panic, and emergency response has resonated deeply with readers still haunted by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.</p>

        <h3>Public Reaction and Official Response</h3>
        <p>Across these 8 zones are pavilions and exhibitions from a total of 158 participating countries, as well as 42 different international agencies, such as The European Union, UNICEF and UNESCO.

The scope of countries taking part is vast. International powerhouses like the USA, China and India, stand alongside micronations like Luxembourg, San Marino, and even the world‚Äôs smallest independent state Vatican City.

Additionally, a host of big names from the Japanese and international business world will also have a presence at the event. Future technology and its potential benefits for us all in the years and decades ahead is a major point of focus.</p>

        <h3>When and Where is the Osaka Expo 2025?</h3>
        <p>The Osaka Expo 2025 opens to the public on April 13th 2025 and runs until October 13th 2025. The venue is Yumeshima, an island of reclaimed land in the Osaka Bay. The Expo is open every day from 9am until 10pm, 7 days a week for its 6 month duration.</p>
            <h3>From Kansai Airport</h3>
            <p>Take the Kanisai Airport Line or the Hanwa Line from Kansai Airport to Tennoji Station. From Tennoji, change to the JR Osaka loop line and alight at Bentencho Station. From Bentencho, you can walk downstairs and transfer to the Osaka Metro Chuo Line. The total journey time from the Airport to Yumeshima Station is about 90 minutes. Please note, this will vary during rush hour and other peak travel times.</p>
        <h3>How Long Should I Allow to Visit the Entire Expo?</h3>
        <p>Everyone is different, but given that the site of Osaka World Expo 2025 is roughly equivalent in size to a medium to large scale theme park, and will probably be just as crowded, we recommend allowing a full day to enjoy the Expo in its entirety.</p>
            <blockquote>
          "It‚Äôs not a prophecy‚Äîit‚Äôs a precautionary tale," the author clarified in a recent post.
        <p>The Osaka Expo 2025 is a once in a generation event, that will once again put the city and its people on the global stage. We hope you‚Äôll enjoy this historic occasion. Please check back regularly here at Osaka.com for further updates as the Expo continues.</p>
